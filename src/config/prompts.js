const PROVEN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `Create a 16×20 inch portrait lifestyle vision board in a \${STYLE_KEYWORDS} editorial collage style. The collage must completely fill the entire 16×20 canvas edge-to-edge with no blank margins, no empty borders, no negative space, and no unused areas anywhere in the layout. Use photographic realism, warm soft lighting, subtle glow, cohesive color harmony, macro close-ups, gentle shadows, and a premium mixed-media aesthetic. Fill the entire canvas edge-to-edge with the collage itself. Do not show a wall, table, background, or blank space around the board. The photos, papers, textures, and objects should reach close to the borders, with only a thin natural margin.

\${THEME_SENTENCE}

The collage should be visually dense with torn layered paper textures, overlapping Polaroid-style frames, soft washi tape, scattered stickers or tiny decorations, and natural variations in angle and rotation. Use 4–6 layers of depth with realistic shadows so the board feels handcrafted and physical. The collage should appear as if the whole image is the board itself, not a board sitting on a surface.

Include approximately \${NUM_ELEMENTS} distinct symbolic objects and photographic mini-scenes arranged as small Polaroids, lifestyle close-ups, or loose objects on the board. Use a unified color palette of \${COLOR_PALETTE}. Blend all elements into one cohesive editorial composition with diagonal movement and asymmetry, avoiding any rigid grid layout.

Symbolic elements to include: \${SYMBOLIC_ELEMENTS}. Each of these must appear once as a distinct visual element, with no duplicates or near-duplicates.

This image must contain absolutely no people, no faces, no silhouettes, no hands, and no body parts whatsoever. Do not include any text, writing, letters, numbers, logos, brands, screens with visible text, book pages, or signage. Any object that would normally have writing, numbers, logos, or labels (such as books, notebooks, packaging, screens, bottles, or signs) must appear with completely blank surfaces or turned so that no characters are visible at all. Do not include any alcohol, nightlife, smoking, weapons, religious or culturally sensitive symbols, political imagery, or unsafe elements. All emotional meaning must be communicated ONLY through inanimate objects, scenes, and abstract visuals.

Create a cohesive, premium, editorial mixed-media collage with layered textures, symbolic lifestyle moments, and polished magazine-quality aesthetics.`;
