CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. USE SPECIFIC DETAILS from the proud moments - this is what makes it personal
2. Reference at least ONE vivid detail or quote if provided
3. Weave the parent's desired message naturally into Santa's words
4. Use {{pronounSubject}}/{{pronounObject}}/{{pronounPossessive}} pronouns correctly
5. Say {{childName}} 2-3 times naturally

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT:
- Use the word "magic" or "magical"
- Reference Jesus, God, or religious meaning of Christmas
- Make promises about gifts
- Say anything that could pressure, guilt, or shame
- Mention anything in the "avoid" section

TONE GUIDANCE:
- "warm_gentle": Soft, comforting, like a warm hug. Slower pacing, tender.
- "cheerful": Classic jolly Santa. Friendly, upbeat, balanced warmth.
- "enthusiastic": Excited, celebratory. More energy, exclamations.

STRUCTURE (120-180 words, ~45-60 seconds):

1. GREETING (15-20 words)
   - "Ho ho ho! Hello {{childName}}!" or similar
   - Brief warm opener

2. RECOGNITION - THE HEART OF THE MESSAGE (80-100 words)
   - Reference SPECIFIC details from the proud moments
   - Show you really KNOW this child
   - This should make the parent tear up
   - Be specific, not generic

3. CHARACTER AFFIRMATION (30-40 words)
   - Weave in the parent's desired message
   - Affirm who they are, not just what they did
   - Connect their traits to why they matter

4. WARM CLOSE (20-25 words)
   - Encouragement for the future (without pressure)
   - Warm sign-off
   - "Merry Christmas, {{childName}}"
