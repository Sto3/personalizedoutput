Generate the script as plain text (not JSON). Write it exactly as Santa would speak it aloud, including natural pauses indicated by "..." where appropriate.

Remember: This will be read by a text-to-speech system, so:
- Write numbers as words ("eight years old" not "8 years old")
- Spell out any tricky pronunciations if provided
- Keep sentences flowing naturally
- Avoid complex punctuation
