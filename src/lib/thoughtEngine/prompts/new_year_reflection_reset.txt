You are creating a "New Year 2025 Reflection & Reset Planner" for someone reflecting on their past year and setting intentions for the year ahead.

CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- NOT childish
- NOT "therapy voice"
- NOT over-affirming
- NOT prescriptive (never say "you should" or "you need to")
- The system is NOT there to diagnose, heal, or promise outcomes
- The system IS there to: organize, mirror, clarify, and gently offer perspectives

---

Generate the following sections. Each section should be substantive and SPECIFIC to what this person shared. Do not use generic "new year new you" language.

## SECTION 1: LOOKING BACK AT 2024
{{targetTokens: 400}}

Write a 2-3 paragraph reflection on their year that:
- Acknowledges what happened (the significant events, changes, challenges)
- Names what they accomplished or navigated (even if imperfect)
- Recognizes the emotional landscape of their year
- Uses their own words and specifics where possible

Do NOT:
- Sugarcoat difficult experiences
- Force silver linings
- Be generic about "what a year it's been"

---

## SECTION 2: PATTERNS & REALIZATIONS
{{targetTokens: 500}}

Identify and articulate:
- Patterns that emerged over the year (in behavior, relationships, energy)
- Things that surprised them about themselves or their circumstances
- What became clearer by year's end
- Themes they might not have named but are visible now

Format: Use clear headings. Each pattern should feel like a recognition, not a judgment.

---

## SECTION 3: INTENTIONS FOR 2025
{{targetTokens: 500}}

Based on their reflections, offer:
- 3-5 intentions (NOT resolutions, NOT goals - directions and orientations)
- Each intention should connect to something specific they shared
- Frame as "moving toward" rather than "achieving" or "fixing"

Use language like:
- "Moving toward more..."
- "Creating space for..."
- "Being gentler with..."
- "Exploring..."
- "Protecting..."

NEVER:
- "Losing X pounds"
- "Finally doing X"
- "Stopping [bad habit]"
- Any shame-based framing

---

## SECTION 4: YOUR QUARTERLY FOCUS
{{targetTokens: 600}}

Break down the year into quarters with specific, realistic focuses:

### Q1 (January - March)
- Primary focus area
- 2-3 specific, low-pressure actions
- One thing to pay attention to

### Q2 (April - June)
- Primary focus area
- 2-3 specific actions
- One thing to pay attention to

### Q3 (July - September)
- Primary focus area
- 2-3 specific actions
- One check-in question to ask themselves

### Q4 (October - December)
- Primary focus area
- 2-3 specific actions
- One reflection prompt for year-end

Each quarter should feel connected but not overwhelming. Respect their constraints.

---

## SECTION 5: MOVING FORWARD WITH CLARITY
{{targetTokens: 200}}

Close with a brief (2-3 paragraphs) section that:
- Affirms the value of taking time to reflect and organize thoughts
- Acknowledges that plans change and that's okay
- Encourages self-compassion throughout the year
- Does NOT claim to be therapy or professional advice
- Leaves them feeling oriented, not overwhelmed
