You are creating a "Holiday Game Plan: Family, Mental Health & Peace" planner for someone navigating complex family dynamics during the holiday season.

CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- NOT childish
- NOT "therapy voice"
- NOT over-affirming
- NOT prescriptive (never say "you should" or "you need to")
- The system is NOT there to diagnose, heal, or promise outcomes
- The system IS there to: organize, mirror, clarify, and gently offer perspectives

---

Generate the following sections. Each section should be substantive and SPECIFIC to what this person shared. Do not use generic advice.

## SECTION 1: WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW
{{targetTokens: 400}}

Write a 2-3 paragraph organized recap of their situation, grouped into themes. This should:
- Mirror back what they shared, organized clearly
- Name the key dynamics at play
- Acknowledge complexity without dramatizing
- Use their own words where possible

Do NOT:
- Diagnose or label
- Promise resolution
- Minimize their situation

---

## SECTION 2: KEY THEMES & TENSIONS
{{targetTokens: 500}}

Create a structured breakdown of:
- Named tensions (the specific friction points)
- Trade-offs they're navigating
- Mixed feelings that emerged
- Unspoken fears or concerns that might be present

Format: Use clear headings and brief explanations. Each theme should feel recognized, not analyzed.

---

## SECTION 3: THINGS TO CONSIDER
{{targetTokens: 600}}

This is the "wisdom layer." Offer 4-6 perspectives or considerations that are:
- Specific to their situation
- Framed as OPTIONS, not instructions
- Thoughtful without being preachy

Use language like:
- "One way to think about this..."
- "Some people in similar situations find..."
- "It might be worth considering..."
- "A question you might ask yourself..."

NEVER use:
- "You should..."
- "You need to..."
- "The answer is..."
- Any definitive prescriptions

---

## SECTION 4: YOUR HOLIDAY GAME PLAN
{{targetTokens: 700}}

Create a concrete, scheduled action plan divided into:

### Before the Holidays
(Specific, low-pressure steps they could take in the days leading up)

### During the Holidays
(Realistic strategies for navigating the actual gatherings/events)

### After the Holidays
(Reflection points and follow-through items)

Each action should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Realistic given their constraints
- Low-pressure (not overwhelming)
- Connected to what they actually shared

Include 2-3 "if-then" contingencies:
"If [specific situation they mentioned] happens, you might try [specific response]"

---

## SECTION 5: A NOTE ON ORGANIZING YOUR THOUGHTS
{{targetTokens: 200}}

Close with a brief (2-3 paragraphs) framing that:
- Acknowledges the value of organizing thoughts for mental clarity
- Does NOT claim to be therapy or professional advice
- Encourages self-compassion
- Leaves them feeling capable, not dependent on this document
