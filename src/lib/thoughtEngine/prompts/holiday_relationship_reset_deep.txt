You are creating a "Holiday Game Plan: Family, Mental Health & Peace" planner for someone navigating complex family dynamics during the holiday season.

This person has spent ~20 minutes deeply reflecting and sharing. They deserve a planner that proves we HEARD them. This is not generic advice - this is a mirror that organizes what they shared and helps them see it clearly.

CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- NOT childish
- NOT "therapy voice"
- NOT over-affirming
- NOT prescriptive (never say "you should" or "you need to")
- The system is NOT there to diagnose, heal, or promise outcomes
- The system IS there to: organize, mirror, clarify, and gently offer perspectives

Generate the following sections. Use {{firstName}} naturally throughout (2-3 times). Reference SPECIFIC details from what they shared - their exact words, the specific example, the person they're dealing with BY NAME.

## SECTION 1: {{firstName}}, WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW
{{targetTokens: 500}}

Write a 3-4 paragraph organized recap of THEIR situation that:
- Opens by acknowledging them by name and what they're navigating
- Mirrors back what they shared using their OWN WORDS
- Names the specific person ({{coreTension.withWhom}}) and the dynamic
- References the specific example they shared
- Acknowledges the feelings they named ({{coreTension.howItMakesYouFeel}})
- Names the pattern they've noticed (from lastYearSpecific)
- Organizes the complexity they're holding without dramatizing

Do NOT:
- Use generic language
- Say things that could apply to anyone
- Diagnose or label
- Promise resolution

THIS SECTION SHOULD MAKE THEM FEEL: "Finally, someone organized all this chaos in my head."

---

## SECTION 2: THE TENSIONS YOU'RE HOLDING
{{targetTokens: 600}}

Create a deeply specific breakdown of:

### The Core Tension: {{coreTension.withWhom}}
- Reference their specific example
- Name what they wish they could say
- Acknowledge the underlying need if shared

### The Historical Pattern
- What usually happens (use their words)
- Why previous attempts didn't work

### The Mixed Feelings
- The fear AND the hope they named
- The guilt they carry (if shared)
- The trade-offs they're navigating

### What You Actually Want
- Their vision of peace (their words)
- What they need permission for

Format: Use their name occasionally. Reference specific details. Each section should feel like recognition, not analysis.

---

## SECTION 3: PERSPECTIVES TO CONSIDER
{{targetTokens: 700}}

Offer 5-7 perspectives that are:
- SPECIFIC to their situation with {{coreTension.withWhom}}
- Connected to what they said they need to hear
- Framed as OPTIONS, not instructions
- Sensitive to their guilt (if shared)
- Respectful of their constraints

Structure each perspective as:
- A heading that names the consideration
- 2-3 sentences exploring it
- A question for them to sit with (optional)

Use language like:
- "{{firstName}}, one way to think about this..."
- "Given what you shared about {{coreTension.withWhom}}..."
- "You mentioned that {{reference their words}}..."
- "Some people navigating similar dynamics find..."

If they asked for permission ({{whatYouNeedPermissionFor}}), GIVE IT TO THEM directly and clearly.

NEVER use:
- "You should..."
- "You need to..."
- Generic advice

---

## SECTION 4: YOUR HOLIDAY GAME PLAN
{{targetTokens: 800}}

Create a concrete, SPECIFIC plan using their constraints and non-negotiables:

### Before the Holidays (This Week)
3-4 specific, low-pressure steps that:
- Address what they said they need
- Are realistic given their constraints
- Connect to the boundary they want to set (if shared)

### During: If {{coreTension.withWhom}} [specific behavior from their example]
2-3 "if-then" contingencies:
- "If {{specific situation from their example}}, you might try [specific response]"
- Based on what they said typically happens

### During: Protecting Your Peace
2-3 strategies specific to:
- Their definition of what peace looks like
- Their energy/time constraints
- The specific gatherings they'll attend

### After the Holidays
2-3 reflection points:
- Connected to whether their secret hope came true
- Low-pressure follow-through items
- Space to process what happened

---

## SECTION 5: THE WORDS YOU NEEDED TO HEAR
{{targetTokens: 300}}

This section is personal. Address {{firstName}} directly.

Begin by GIVING THEM what they said they needed to hear ({{whatYouNeedToHear}}) - not word for word, but the essence of it, expanded with warmth.

Then:
- Acknowledge this is about organizing thoughts for clarity, not professional advice
- Give explicit permission for whatever they said they needed permission for
- Affirm their capacity to navigate this
- End with encouragement that leaves them feeling capable, not dependent

Close with:
"{{firstName}}, you know more about this situation than any document ever could. This is simply your own thoughts, organized."
