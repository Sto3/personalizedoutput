You are creating a "2025 Reflection & Reset Planner" for {{firstName}}, someone who has spent ~20 minutes deeply reflecting on their year and their hopes for the next.

This person has been brave enough to name their struggles, their growth, their secret dreams. They deserve a planner that proves we HEARD them - that uses their specific moments, their exact words, their real feelings.

CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- NOT childish
- NOT "new year new you" clichés
- NOT over-affirming
- NOT prescriptive (never say "you should" or "you need to")
- The system IS there to: organize, mirror, illuminate patterns, and honor what they shared

Generate the following sections. Use {{firstName}} naturally throughout. Reference SPECIFIC moments, their exact words, the patterns they named. This should feel like their year, organized and reflected back with clarity.

## SECTION 1: {{firstName}}, YOUR 2024
{{targetTokens: 600}}

Write a 4-5 paragraph reflection that:
- Opens by acknowledging the three words they chose: {{yearOverview.threeWordsToDescribe}}
- Tells the STORY of their year using their specific moments
- References their biggest accomplishment by name
- Names the challenge they faced
- Weaves in BOTH significant moments with specific details
- Acknowledges the unexpected joy AND any loss they shared
- Uses their OWN WORDS frequently

Do NOT:
- Sugarcoat or force silver linings
- Use generic "what a year" language
- Skip over the difficult parts

THIS SECTION SHOULD MAKE THEM FEEL: "I didn't realize how much happened. Someone finally organized it all."

---

## SECTION 2: WHAT YOU DISCOVERED
{{targetTokens: 600}}

Create a deeply personal section about what 2024 taught {{firstName}}:

### The Strength You Found
- Reference their specific answer about the strength they discovered
- Connect it to one of their significant moments
- Show them the pattern

### The Pattern You Named
- Directly reference what they said about patterns in themselves
- Connect it to specific examples from their year
- Ask a question that deepens their understanding

### What Surprised You
- Use their exact words about what surprised them
- Connect it to who they're becoming

### About Relationships
- Reference their relationship insight if shared
- Connect to specific moments or challenges

### What You're Ready to Release
- Honor what they said they need to let go of
- If they mentioned self-forgiveness, acknowledge that with tenderness
- If they mentioned a conversation needed, acknowledge the courage that requires

---

## SECTION 3: 2025 - THE YEAR OF {{oneWordForNextYear | uppercase}}
{{targetTokens: 600}}

Based on everything {{firstName}} shared, offer:

### The Word You Chose: {{oneWordForNextYear}}
- Reflect on why this word might have chosen them
- Connect it to what they said about how they want to feel
- Show how it relates to their year

### Intentions, Not Resolutions
Create 5-6 intentions that:
- Flow directly from what they shared
- Are framed as "moving toward" not "fixing"
- Connect to their secret dream if shared
- Address the one thing that MUST change
- Feel realistic given what might get in their way

### The Support You Need
- Reference their answer about support needed
- Suggest how to ask for it

### Protecting This Year
- Address what they said might get in their way
- Offer perspectives on navigating those obstacles

NEVER use shame-based framing or generic resolutions.

---

{{#if includeQuarterlyBreakdown}}
## SECTION 4: YOUR QUARTERLY FOCUS
{{targetTokens: 700}}

Break down 2025 into quarters, with each quarter connected to their specific goals and intentions:

### Q1: January - March | "Foundations"
- Primary focus connected to their most urgent intention
- 2-3 specific, low-pressure actions
- One thing to pay attention to (connected to patterns they noticed)
- Check-in question for March

### Q2: April - June | "Momentum"
- Building on Q1
- Connected to their career/purpose intention if shared
- Actions that feel natural, not forced
- Mid-year reflection prompt

### Q3: July - September | "Integration"
- The middle of the year
- Connected to relationship or personal intentions
- Space for their secret dream if shared
- What to watch for

### Q4: October - December | "Harvest"
- Looking back at the year of {{oneWordForNextYear}}
- How they'll know if they felt what they wanted to feel
- Preparation for next year's reflection
- A prompt to return to this document

Each quarter should respect their constraints and what might get in their way.

## SECTION {{#if includeQuarterlyBreakdown}}5{{else}}4{{/if}}: A YEAR FROM NOW
{{targetTokens: 400}}

Address {{firstName}} directly. This is the closing.

Begin with:
"{{firstName}}, you've just done something most people never do - you've paused long enough to truly look at your life."

Then:
- Reference what they want to carry forward from their significant moments
- Acknowledge the word {{oneWordForNextYear}} and what it means for them
- If they shared a secret dream, honor it: "And that dream you mentioned..."
- Give them permission for whatever they need permission for
- Acknowledge this is about organizing thoughts, not professional advice
- End with something that leaves them feeling oriented and capable

Close with something like:
"A year from now, when you read this again, may you recognize the person who was brave enough to reflect honestly - and may you see how far you've come."
